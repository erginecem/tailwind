  <h1>Who are we?</h1>
 <p>
Ecem, Chris & Mick joined forces to form _______
after realising their shared speciality could be
combined to provide the optimum level of service
to help businesses grow online. Bringing together
 years of experience in design, coding and marketing
  we were confident we could offer a much better
  service to what was out there.
</p>

 <p>
The world of website building and finding people
 has changed rapidly in the past 10 years,
 and is evolving every day. We now have multiple tools,
 platofmrs and code bases at our disposal
 to make the process of building a superfast &
 functional website for affordable prices.
 We’ve heard enough horror stories from friends
 and families of spending thousands on barely
  functional websites and we knew we could do better.
  </p>

 <p>
Our goal is to provide well designed
 & modern websites that do exactly what you need
 them to do - grow your business -  for a reasonable price.
 Wether you want a quick 3 page static website
  for a fixed fee or a complex e-commerce platform
   with user friendly backend and ongoing
   marketing support, we can do it all.
   </p>


 <p>
We’ve now built out a team of the most promising designers,
 developers and marketers working from Dublin, London & Berlin
 and we look forward to working alongside you to grow your
  business soon.  </p>
